### Hi there 👋🌲

Welcome to my profile! Be free to use and share the source code, I hope you will find something interesting! 🔭 🌱

At the moment, I'm a Data Scientist and Principal Investigator at Goodyear Innovation Centre. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Luxembourg University, Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust [(SnT)](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt). I completed my PhD journey in [SERVAL](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/serval) research unit (headed by [Prof. Yves Le Traon](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon)), while being a research assistant of [Prof. Michail (Mike) Papadakis](https://mpapad.github.io/).

My academic and industrial interests revolve around the areas of Automated Software Engineering. In particular, Software Evolution, Automated Software Testing, Code Analysis, Fault Injection and various other sub-fields. In a nutshell, Intelligent Software Engineering (synergy between Machine Learning (ML) and Software Engineering) are domains I'm passionate about.

In my research, given a code regression change, I tackled the challenges of developing high-quality test cases, their selection, prioritization, and thoroughness for a source code.

My inspiration is to contribute and deliver practical and powerful optimisation solutions to software practitioners - by fusing highly assured software delivered at a reasonable cost, with partial or complete automation to the testers. 🔬👨‍🔬👨‍💻🧩

I'm always looking to collaborate! 👯🙏 Feel free also to get in touch through social media (👇), or my work email!
