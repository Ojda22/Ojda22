### Hi there 👋🌲

Welcome to my profile! Be free to use and share the source code, I hope you will find something interesting! 🔭 🌱

At the moment, I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Luxembourg University, Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust [(SnT)](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt). I work in [SERVAL](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/serval) research unit (headed by [Prof. Yves Le Traon](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon)), while being research assistant of [Prof. Michail (Mike) Papadakis](https://mpapad.github.io/).

My academic and industrial interests revolve around the area of Software Engineering. In particular, Software Evolution, Software Testing, Code Analysis, Fault Injection and Intelligent Software Engineering (synergy between Machine Learning (ML) and Software Engineering) are domains I'm passionate about.

I tackle the challenges of developing high-quality test cases, their selection, prioritization and thoroughness for a source code given a regression change.

My inspiration is to contribute and deliver practical and powerful test environments to software practitioners - by fusing highly assured software, delivered at a reasonable cost, with partial or complete automation to the testers. 🔬👨‍🔬👨‍💻🧩

I'm always looking to collaborate! 👯🙏 Feel free also to get in touch through social media (👇), or my work email!
